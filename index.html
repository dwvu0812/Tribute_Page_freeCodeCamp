            <ul class="list-info">
                <br>
                <li><b>1955</b> - She was born in Kisújszállás, Hungary, in a small home without running water, a refrigerator, or television.</li>
                <br>
                <br>
                <li><b>1985</b> - After earning her Ph.D. at the University of Szeged, Karikó continued her research and postdoctoral studies at the Institute of Biochemistry, Biological Research Centre of Hungary. In 1985, the lab lost its funding, and she left Hungary for the United States with her husband and 2-year daughter.</li>
                <br>
                <br>
                <li><b>Between 1985 and 1988</b> - Karikó participated in a clinical trial in which patients with AIDS, hematologic diseases, and chronic fatigue syndrome were treated with double stranded RNA (dsRNA).</li>
                <br>
                <br>
                <li><b>1989</b> - She was hired by the University of Pennsylvania and worked with cardiologist Elliot Barnathan on Messenger RNA (mRNA) </li>
                <br>
                <br>
                <li><b>1997</b> - She met Drew Weissman, professor of immunology at the University of Pennsylvania. Her persistence was noted as exceptional against the norms of academic research work conditions.</li>
                <br>
                <br>
                <li><b>2005</b> - Karikó and Weissman described how specific nucleoside modifications in mRNA led to a reduced immune response.</li>
                <br>
                <br>
                <li><b>In early 2013</b> - Karikó heard of Moderna's $240 million deal with AstraZeneca to develop a Vascular endothelial growth factor mRNA. Karikó realized that she would not get a chance to apply her experience with mRNA at the University of Pennsylvania, so she took a role as vice president at BioNTech RNA Pharmaceuticals (and subsequently became a senior vice president in 2019).</li>
                <br>
                <br>
                <li><b>2020</b> - the Karikó and Weissman technology was however also used within vaccines for COVID-19 that were produced by Pfizer (developed by BioNTech) and by Moderna.</li>
